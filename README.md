# Internship 2024/25
This is a collection of tasks and projects that I worked on during the years 2024 and 2025. Each one is as well documented as I could manage. Whenever possible, I used Jupyter notebooks to combine documentation, visualizations, and code, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the work. The goal was to make it possible to view the output of this internship through GitHub web interface for a comfortable and easy read.

## Separation
In this repository, you’ll find several directories named after the main tasks or projects completed during this period. However, many of these directories contain more than just the main script. Some include helper scripts that showcase data characteristics, like its shape or the collection of file names.

Some projects were quite large and warranted separate repositories, but don’t worry, everything is still well documented and visualized for clarity.
