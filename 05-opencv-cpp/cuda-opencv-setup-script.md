This task involved creating a script to install the necessary components for downloading, building, and testing OpenCV. These components include a C++ compiler, CMake, Git, cuDNN, and the CUDA Toolkit.

The script is designed to simplify the setup process for development and make it easier for others to use opencv with c++.
