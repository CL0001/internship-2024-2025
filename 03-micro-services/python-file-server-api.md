This time, the task was to create a microservice that accepts files from users, especially CSV files, and dockerize it, as it will be connected to the main ECG system.  
The service saves the files inside the server's file system, generates a UUID for each file, and stores additional information in the server's database for later retrieval.

The repository containing this can be found here:
